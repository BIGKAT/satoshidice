This repository holds the static html pages from http://SatoshiDice.com
and also the hash keys to the secrets that are revealed after each 
expires.

The purpose of this is to have an independant archive of the
site since the information on the site is used to for financial
transactions which need to be verified at a later time.

The only file that is really critical to have archived is the hash.keys
and that has data through the year 2021, so it should never change.
The file's sha1sum on May 1, 2012 is:
 d5f03cad9c3e0e2fac85fd0ba110d41fb31a20e2
 
$ sha1sum hash.keys
d5f03cad9c3e0e2fac85fd0ba110d41fb31a20e2  hash.keys
